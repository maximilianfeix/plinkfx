description: Design, render and measure game sound effects as code with plinkfx. Use when the user wants a sound effect for a game or UI ("a heavy door for a dungeon", "a softer coin", "a laser that sounds like 1985"), wants to tweak an existing plinkfx sound, or needs WAV/OGG files of game sounds. Produces a plinkfx parameter object plus a WAV, checked against loudness and peak limits. Runs locally through the plinkfx CLI; no network, no AI audio models.

# plinkfx: sound effects as code

plinkfx sounds are small JSON objects (layers of oscillators or noise with envelopes, pitch sweeps,
filters and a few effects) that a 2 KB player renders in the browser, and the `plinkfx` CLI renders
to WAV. You design a sound by writing that object, rendering it, measuring it, and adjusting.

**You cannot hear.** Say so once. Your checks are numbers and spectrograms; the user's ears decide.
Always hand the user the WAV and ask them to listen before calling a sound done.

## 0. Setup (once)

```bash
npx plinkfx --version          # or: npm i -D plinkfx
```

Everything below uses `npx plinkfx`. Inside the plinkfx repo itself use `node dist/cli.js`.

## 1. Start from the catalogue

161 sounds in 13 categories already exist and are tuned. Reuse before you invent.

```bash
npx plinkfx list               # all sounds: name, category, description
npx plinkfx list mechanic      # one category: ui pickup jump hit explosion powerup shoot footstep magic alert jingle mechanic world
npx plinkfx show door-heavy    # the parameter object
```

If a sound is close, copy its object and change it. Pick the nearest sound as your **reference** for step 3.

## 2. Write the sound

Save it as `sounds/<name>.json` in the user's project (create the folder). Read
[reference.md](reference.md) for every field, the defaults and recipes per category. The essentials:

```json
{
  "verb": [0.6, 0.3],
  "layers": [
    { "wave": "saw", "freq": 30, "to": 45, "vib": [2.5, 3], "bp": 700, "q": 6, "a": 0.1, "h": 0.5, "d": 0.2 },
    { "wave": "brown", "lp": 300, "at": 0.8, "a": 0.001, "d": 0.6, "shape": 2.5, "gain": 1.6, "drive": 1 },
    { "wave": "sine", "freq": 70, "to": 32, "at": 0.8, "a": 0.001, "d": 0.5, "drive": 1.5 }
  ]
}
```

Think in layers, like a sound designer: **transient** (1-30 ms click or noise burst) + **body** (the
pitched or filtered part that says what it is) + **tail** (decay, reverb, echo). Cheap-sounding
sounds are usually one layer with a linear decay.

## 3. Render, measure, compare

```bash
npx plinkfx level sounds/door.json --like door-heavy   # sets "gain": reference loudness, true peak <= -1 dBTP
npx plinkfx measure sounds/door.json --like door-heavy
npx plinkfx render sounds/door.json -o door.wav
```

`measure` prints duration, loudness (max momentary LUFS), integrated LUFS, peak, true peak, spectral
centroid (brightness) and DC, next to the reference. Before rendering, write down the target in one
line, for example: *"0.9-1.3 s, dark (centroid under 900 Hz), thud at the end, loudness near the
reference"*. Then compare:

| Measured vs. target | Change |
|---|---|
| too long / short | `d`, `h`, `at` of the layers; tail comes from `verb` size and `echo` feedback |
| too bright | lower `lp`/`lpTo`, fewer square/saw/noise layers, less `drive` |
| too dull | raise `lp`, add a `noise` layer with `hp` 3000+, or a square/saw layer |
| no punch | add a 5-30 ms transient layer (`noise` + `hp`, `a: 0.001`), add a sine thump (`freq` 60-150 `to` 35-50) |
| true peak above -1 dBTP, or loudness off | run `npx plinkfx level` again after every change |
| sounds static when repeated | raise `vary` (semitones between takes, default 0.4) |

Optional, to see it: `ffmpeg -i door.wav -lavfi showspectrumpic=s=800x300:legend=0 door.png` and read
the image (a click shows as a vertical line at the start; aliasing as mirrored diagonal lines).

Iterate at most 5 rounds. Keep a short log of what you changed and why.

## 4. Deliver

Give the user:

1. the file `sounds/<name>.json`,
2. `<name>.wav` (plus `--variant 1..3` takes if they want variety),
3. the last `measure` output,
4. how to play it:

```js
import { play } from "plinkfx/core";
import door from "./sounds/door.json" with { type: "json" };
play(door);
```

5. one sentence: "I can't hear it: please listen and tell me what to change (darker, shorter, more punch...)."

For files for an engine: `npx plinkfx export assets/sfx --format both` writes every catalogue sound as
48 kHz mono WAV and OGG. In Godot, keep the import's Normalize off; in Unity, leave Force To Mono on
and use Decompress On Load for short sounds.

## Don'ts

- Don't copy presets or samples from other tools or packs unless their licence allows it.
- Don't claim a sound "sounds great". Report the numbers and let the user listen.
- Don't exceed -1 dBTP or ship sounds longer than about 4 s; those are loops or music, not effects.
